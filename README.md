Android Calculator
Project Overview
This Advanced Android Calculator is a comprehensive mobile application developed as part of an internship project with Prodigy InfoTech. It goes beyond basic arithmetic operations to offer a range of advanced mathematical functions, providing users with a powerful and versatile calculation tool. The code for this project is available in the master branch.

Key Features
Basic Arithmetic Operations: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Advanced Mathematical Functions: Square root, exponentiation, trigonometric functions (sin, cos, tan), and logarithms.
Dynamic Result Display: Real-time calculation results shown as you input expressions.
Error Handling: Robust error management for invalid expressions and arithmetic errors.
Expandable Interface: Unique menu system to access advanced functions, optimizing screen real estate.
Sleek Material Design: Modern UI adhering to Material Design principles for an intuitive user experience.

Technical Highlights:
Kotlin Implementation: Fully developed in Kotlin, leveraging its concise syntax and null safety features.
View Binding: Utilized for type-safe interaction with UI elements, enhancing code reliability.
Expression Parsing: Integrated the exp4j library for efficient mathematical expression evaluation.
Custom Styles: Implemented custom button styles for a cohesive and visually appealing interface.
Dynamic Layouts: Employed ConstraintLayout and LinearLayout for a responsive design across various screen sizes.

Unique Contributions:
Expandable Advanced Functions Panel:
Implemented a hidden LinearLayout containing additional mathematical operations.
Created a custom onMenuClick function to toggle the visibility of this panel, enhancing the app's functionality without cluttering the main interface.
Custom ImageView for Menu Access:
Designed and integrated a menu icon as an ImageView.
Implemented onClickListener for smooth interaction with the advanced functions panel.
Real-time Expression Evaluation:
Developed an onEqual function that provides instant calculation feedback as users input their expressions.

Learning Outcomes:
Through this project, I gained significant experience and knowledge in:
Android app architecture and lifecycle management.
Implementing complex mathematical operations in mobile applications.
Creating responsive and intuitive user interfaces using XML layouts.
Efficient error handling and user input validation in real-time applications.
Integrating third-party libraries (exp4j) to extend app functionality.
Applying Material Design principles for enhanced user experience.
Implementing dynamic UI elements for improved app interactivity.

Conclusion
This Advanced Android Calculator project demonstrates a strong grasp of Android development principles, creative problem-solving in UI/UX design, and the ability to implement complex functionality in a user-friendly manner. The project showcases not only technical proficiency in Kotlin and Android SDK but also a keen understanding of user needs in mobile application design.
